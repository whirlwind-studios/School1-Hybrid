# School1-Hybrid

Hybrid implementation with web technologies.

## Cordova Ionic

[Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) is a subproject of Cordova, not only providing an interface to develop cross-platform apps with web technologies, but also compiling into different styles, according to the platform, making it a great choice to deliver high-quality apps easily. As Android is already covered, this will only be used for Universal Windows Platform and iOS. If it also seems like the right platform to deliver a responsive web app, we will reuse the built static HTML and JavaScript files.

We haven't yet started to develop with Ionic, but will do so in the near future.

### Testing

See the [Ionic Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/) page for more details.

### Miscellaneous

Building will probably be done with [PhoneGap](https://build.phonegap.com/), at least if there is no one in our community who has a Mac to build it with the iOS SDK (Maybe we can borrow one from a friend or something). Windows Phone/UWP will be built on a local PC.

## Electron

[Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) is an Open Source platform provided by Github itself an the part of School1 with the tiniest invested effort yet. It's more like a future idea than a concrete plan, but would be nice for those desktop users out there, and could either reuse things built with Ionic, or use a <a name="web"></a>responsive framework like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to provide a excellent experience for both Desktop users and the Web.

### Testing

See the [Electron Getting Started](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) Github Repository for more details.

### Miscellaneous

Please let us know what you think about reusing files from Ionic!
